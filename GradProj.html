    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This project takes the scientific simulation made by the Univerisity of Washington <a href="http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/RBM/download.shtml">here</a>
        and optimizes it serially and makes it run in parallel. This project
	was completed and defended in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project has a number of interesting challenges.  First off, from a Software Engineering standpoint, I'm taking
        a nontrivial amount of unknown code and having to write a test case suite to ensure integrity over time as I work on optimizing it.
        From a performance stand point this program has a variety of optimizations that can be made from compacting
        needlessly duplicated for loops, to large loops that can be distributed across many cores. Finally, this project isn't purely
        academic.  It is being worked on for the Agriculture Science Department at CalPoly which plays into my considerations
        of what to pursue while working on it.
