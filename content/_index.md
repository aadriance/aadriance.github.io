Hello! I'm Andrew. I'm passionate about hardware errors, the history of
computers and programming languages, and keyboards!

I started programming with my friend in the third grade when we discovered a
program called GameMaker. Ever since then I've had a love for bringing thing
to life through code. This later inspired us to work on MonsterBuild. These
days I like to spend my time digging into new programming languages, new
technologies, and new styles of writing programs.

I currently work at NVIDIA, focused on RAS for server hardware.
