Hello! I'm Andrew. When I'm not programming I'm either taking care 
of my sweet baby Moira, French Bulldog Pepper or hanging out with 
my wife McKenzie.


I started programming with my friend in the third grade when we discovered a program called GameMaker. Ever since then I've had a love for bringing things to life through code. This later inspired us to work on MonsterBuild. These days I like to spend my time digging into new programming languages, new technologies, and new styles of writing programs.


I attended the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, for a Masters of Science in Computer Science. Currently I work at Microsoft full time doing kernel development on Windows.
