This site started with a cheeky "Hello World" post in 2019. I has ambitions of writing for this site, but failed until 2022 when I found the time to do a silly piece of satire crossing the mediums of code and writing. This month that trajectory changes.

I will be authoring one post a week for a month. That will bring this sites total article count to 8. If ambition grasps me I may yet ascend to the double digits.

Why am I doing this? I have no readers, no immediate intentions of promotion. I do however run documentation effort for my team at Microsoft, and have always scrawled ideas on pieces of paper. I have the desire to write, but have not committed the time needed to do it.

Sometimes we need to **JUST DO IT**. That is what I'll be doing this month, setting aside my ambitions of writing in favor of writing.

That's all for now, though I hope to see you next week for what piece of writing I manage to conjure.
