# Description
MonsterMe is a fun avatar building app where your monster can run around in a world of your own creation. Many avatar creators either give you no guidance, or give you so much guidance you are limited to a few points where you can snap objects. MonsterMe sets out to find a happy inbetween where you can still make a wide range of avatars that look good without so much guidance that you feel like you can't make what you want.

# Highlights
