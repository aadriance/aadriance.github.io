# Description

This project was created while studying various research on automated testing tools. It takes a python file, tools the code to keep track of the programs execution path, and then it starts running it against random inputs attempting to create a crash. PyFuzz can be found [here](https://github.com/aadriance/530-pyFuzz). Black box testing isn't very effective for finding crashes, but it was a worthwhile learning experience.


- Tooling python code
- Automatically runs code with random inputs
- Tracks code execution
- Gives a code coverage rating for the run
