# Description

Dodge Dungeon was created as a final project for my Interactive Entertainment class. The goal of the game was to make a challenging old school dungeon crawler with a wide range of fun and interesting bullet patterns for both visual enjoyment, and for the player to learn how to dodge. The game contains a save system that tracks progress as you travel through the 3 dungeons to relearn the name of your character.

# Highlights

- Wide variety of enemies with different attack patterns
- Three levels of sprawling dungeons
- Fast-paced combat
