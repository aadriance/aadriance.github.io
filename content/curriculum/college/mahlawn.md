# Description

'Oh My Lawn!' was created to explore various aspects of the world of real time computer graphics. It required a constant balance between adding new features, and maintaining framerate. It was a valuable experience learning how to deal with adding new features and interactions to a piece of software without sacrificing the responsivness of the product.

This project also gave exposure to many new technologies I didn't work with in my introduction course for Computer Graphics. Specifics on what technologies where implemented are listed in the highlights list below.

# Highlights

- View Frustum Culling
- Deferred Shading
- Shadow Mapping
- Billboard Particle System
- 3D Positional Sound
- Non-photorealistic rendering including edge detection
- A* AI system
- World grid as a uniform spatial data structure
- Bounding Sphere Collision Detection
- Model hierarchy with animations
- JSON resource loader
- Sky Box
